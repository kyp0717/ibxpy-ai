# TWS Trading App Context Engineering 
This file provides guidance for working with code in this repository.  
It contains rules for python development and deployment 

## Project Structure
- Context files are in the `context/` folder
- Project artifacts are at root level:
  - `/tests` - Unit tests and integration tests
  - `/docs` - Documentation (architecture, API, installation)
  - `/scripts` - Helper and installation scripts
  - `/src` - Application source code

## Context File Structure
- Context-specific files in `context/` folder:
  - `CLAUDE.md` - This file with project guidelines
  - `project-plan/` - Project phases and architecture plans
  - `tasks.md` - Task tracking and status
  - `requirements.md` - Project requirements
  - `logs/` - Claude phase completion summaries (NOT application logs)

## Project Awareness & Context
- At the start of a new conversation, read files in `project-plan/` to review project's architecture, style, and constraints.
- At the start of a new conversation, read task.md to review project's architecture, style, and constraints.
- At the start of a new conversation, read `requirements.md`to review project's architecture, style, and constraints.
- At the start of a new conversation, review sessions log files in folder `logs` to understand project status and issues.

## Testing 
- **IMPORTANT: Always use the python-phase-tester agent (Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose") for implementing all phase tests.**
- Create a python virtual environment for testing using uv.
- Please perform all tests within this virtual environment.
- Tests are located in `/tests` at the project root.
- All test codes should reside in the tests folder.
- Do not write test results or update README.md after testing.
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.

## Logs (Claude Context)
- Logs folder remains in `context/logs/` - these are Claude-specific phase summaries
- When each phase is completed successfully, create a high level summary
- Log summary should be no more than 16 lines
- Summary should be concise and high level overview
- Each summary should have 1 heading only and several bullet points
- Do not use icons in the log files
- Do not mention next phase or previous phase in the summary
- The format of the log file should look like this phase_xx_yyyymmdd.md
- The summary should also be datestamped and timestamped
- If a phase has been reimplemented or updated, summarize the changes and
  append the summary to the existing log file with datestamp and timestamp

## Scripts 
- All shell scripts are located in `/scripts` at the project root
- Installation scripts, helper scripts, and automation tools go here
- Do not save scripts in other directories  

## Documents 
- All documentation is in `/docs` at the project root
- Documentation structure:
  - `/docs/architecture/` - System design and architecture docs
  - `/docs/api/` - API specifications and endpoint documentation
  - `/docs/installation/` - Setup and installation guides
- Create new subfolders as needed for organization  

## General Principles:
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** â€“ only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `task.md`.

## Implementation Guideline
- Focus exclusively on completing a single, well-defined feature before moving to the next.
* Definition of Done: A task or feature is completed is defined by the following:
- All tests are written and passing.
- The code is confirmed to work in the real target environment.
- Integration with the actual system is verified.
- Documentation has been updated
- **NO FEATURE CREEP**: Resist the urge to add "nice-to-have" functionalities until the current, core feature is 100% completed and verified.
- When you are adding a new feature such as a new method or function, stop to ask whether me permission to build feature.
- Please fully explain reason for the function as a comment

## ðŸ“¦ Adding New Features - Standard Procedure
### Feature Development Pattern
* When adding any new feature to this project, follow this established pattern:

1. **Module Structure**
   - Create a new file in `src/` named after your feature (e.g., `email_lookup.py`, `data_validator.py`)
   - Define main struct and any result types needed
   - Implement core logic following existing patterns from `phone_lookup.py` 

2. **Independent Testing**
   - Create unit tests in `tests/test_your_feature_unit.py`

5. **Development Process**
   - Follow strict TDD: RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR
   - Implement minimal code to pass test
   - Refactor only after tests pass
   - Each feature must be completely independent and self-contained
   - Ask for permission before adding new methods or functions to existing modules

## Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Never hardcode sensitive information - Always use .env files for API keys and configuration

### ðŸ“Ž Modification Guideline
- When modifying code, always ... tbd 

### ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.
