### Summary - Phase 7
- Prompt simplified: "**AAPL** >>> Open Trade at $X.XX (press enter) ?"
- Removed "Press Enter to continue" after order fill
- Automatic transition to PnL monitoring mode
- Fill timestamp captured once and persists
- Order status format: **Stock** [TWS Order Status]

### Summary - Phase 8  
- PnL display: **Stock** [TWS PnL] $X.XX --- GAIN/LOSS
- Green color for GAIN (\033[92m)
- Red color for LOSS (\033[91m)
- Close position prompt without "to accept"
- Seamless position lifecycle management

### Key Accomplishments
- No manual intervention after order fill
- Automatic PnL monitoring begins immediately
- Fill timestamp doesn't update during monitoring
- Absolute PnL values (no +/- signs)
- Complete trading cycle: open → monitor → close

### Technical Implementation
- fill_timestamp stored in order_result object
- Automatic transition with 2-second notification
- Color codes: Green (92m) for gains, Red (91m) for losses
- 1-second auto-refresh throughout monitoring

### Test Results
- PnL color coding verified (green/red)
- Timestamp persistence confirmed
- Automatic transitions working
- Phase 7 & 8 final implementation complete
