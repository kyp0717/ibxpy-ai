### Summary
- Implemented real-time PnL tracking for filled orders
- PnL displayed continuously after order fill
- Color-coded display: Red for losses, Yellow for gains
- Format: [TWS PnL SYMBOL] $+/-XXX.XX
- PnL updates with every quote refresh

### Key Accomplishments
- Position tracking in OrderClient.positions dictionary
- calculate_pnl() function computes unrealized P&L
- format_pnl_display() handles color coding
- PnL shown below filled order status
- Updates automatically as market price changes
- Persists throughout trading session

### Technical Implementation  
- Positions tracked on order fill in orderStatus()
- PnL = (current_price - avg_cost) * quantity
- ANSI color codes: \033[91m (red), \033[93m (yellow)
- Display refreshes with quote updates
- Integrated seamlessly with Phase 7 monitoring

### Test Results
- PnL calculation verified with test position
- Color coding confirmed (yellow for gains)
- Display format matches specification
- Phase 8 implementation complete
