- When detecting unusual market conditions

### 4. phase-documentation-generator
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Purpose**: Automatically generate comprehensive documentation

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Create API documentation from code
- Generate sequence diagrams for trading flows
- Document error codes and recovery procedures
- Create user guides for each phase
- Maintain a troubleshooting guide
- Generate README updates

**When to Invoke**:
- After completing each phase
- When adding new features
- Before major releases

### 5. performance-profiler
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Purpose**: Monitor and optimize application performance

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Track order execution latency
- Monitor memory usage with streaming data
- Profile EMA calculation performance
- Identify bottlenecks in data processing
- Suggest optimizations for real-time operations
- Track API call frequencies

**When to Invoke**:
- During performance testing
- When latency issues are detected
- Periodically in production

### 6. trade-audit-reporter
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Purpose**: Generate detailed trading reports and analytics

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Create daily P&L reports
- Track commission analysis
- Generate tax reports (Form 8949 preparation)
- Analyze trading patterns and performance metrics
- Create risk exposure reports
- Generate compliance reports

**When to Invoke**:
- End of trading day
- On-demand for specific periods
- For monthly/quarterly reviews

### 7. deployment-coordinator
**Priority**: LOW

**Purpose**: Handle deployment and environment management

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Manage different configurations (dev/paper/live)
- Handle secrets and API keys securely
- Coordinate database migrations
- Manage virtual environment updates
- Automate backup and recovery procedures
- Version control and release management

**When to Invoke**:
- During deployment to different environments
- When updating dependencies
- For disaster recovery procedures

## Integration Architecture

```
Application Flow with Agents:
================================

main.py 
   ↓
[tws-connection-monitor]
   ├─ Ensures stable connection

   └─ Monitors connection health
   ↓
[market-data-validator]
   ├─ Validates incoming data
   ├─ Filters bad ticks
   └─ Handles market conditions
   ↓
[trading-strategy-validator]
   ├─ Validates orders
   ├─ Checks risk limits
   └─ Ensures compliance
   ↓
Order Execution
   ↓
[trade-audit-reporter]
   ├─ Logs all activities
   ├─ Generates reports
   └─ Tracks performance
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 - Critical Agents (Implement First)
1. **trading-strategy-validator** - Prevents costly trading errors
2. **tws-connection-monitor** - Ensures system reliability
3. **market-data-validator** - Maintains data integrity

### Phase 2 - Enhancement Agents (Implement Second)
4. **performance-profiler** - Optimizes system performance
5. **trade-audit-reporter** - Provides transparency and compliance

### Phase 3 - Support Agents (Implement Last)
6. **phase-documentation-generator** - Maintains documentation
7. **deployment-coordinator** - Streamlines deployment

## Benefits of Agent Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a specific responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Agents can be reused across different projects
3. **Maintainability**: Updates to specific functionality are isolated
4. **Testability**: Each agent can be tested independently
5. **Scalability**: New agents can be added without affecting existing ones
6. **Parallel Development**: Multiple agents can be developed simultaneously
7. **Error Isolation**: Failures in one agent don't cascade to others

## Agent Communication Protocol

Agents should communicate through:
- Structured events (publish-subscribe pattern)
- Shared state management (with proper locking)
- Message queues for async operations
- Well-defined interfaces and contracts

## Monitoring and Observability

Each agent should provide:
- Health check endpoints
- Performance metrics
- Error rates and types
- Activity logs
- Resource usage statistics

## Conclusion

Implementing these specialized agents will transform the TWS Trading Application into a robust, production-ready system with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive validation, and extensive monitoring capabilities. The modular agent architecture ensures the system can evolve and scale while maintaining code quality and reliability.
