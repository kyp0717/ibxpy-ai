    - Display the heading with "FEATURE TEST: Phase xx - new_feature"
    - Display test input and test output 
    - If test fail, display failure in red in the console.
    - If test is successful, display success in green in the console.
8. Do not build project structure unless it is explicitly directed in this project plan.
9. Bash scripts should be saved to `scripts` folder.
10. Documentation generated by AI should be saved to `docs` folder.

## Project Type and Structure
- This is a **standalone application**, NOT a distributable library
- Use a flat module structure directly in src/ folder
- Do NOT create nested package folders (no src/ibxpy_ai/)
- Main entry point should be src/main.py
- Import pattern: modules are imported directly from src/

## Goal
- Build a python app to trade stock using interactive broker trader workstation.
- Use the python package ibapi which is published interactive broker. 
- Do not use third party package such as ib_async, ib_insync or ibridepy.
